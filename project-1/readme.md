# project 1

- Your employer is trying to make a proof of concept on how a Blockchain application can be implemented in his company.

- He is an astronomy fan and because of that he spends most of his free time searching stars in the sky, that's why he wants to create a test application that allows him and his friends to register stars, and track the ownership of each.

## requirements

- The application will create a Genesis Block when we run the application.

- The user will request the application to send a message to be signed using a Wallet and in this way verify the ownership over the wallet address. The message format will be:

```sh
<WALLET_ADRESS>:${new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0,-3)}:starRegistry
```

- Once the user has the message they can use a Wallet (Electrum or Bitcoin Core for example) to sign the message.

- The user will try to submit the Star object for that. The submission will consist of: wallet address, message, signature and the star object with the star information. The Start information will be formed in this format:

```sh
"star": {
         "dec": "68Â° 52' 56.9",
         "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
         "story": "Testing the story 4"
     }

```

- The application will verify if the time elapsed from the request ownership (the time is contained in the message) and the time when you submit the star is less than 5 minutes.

- If everything is okay the star information will be stored in the block and added to the chain encoding the Star information.

- The application will allow us to retrieve the Star objects belong to an owner (wallet address). This information should be human readable so it shouldn't be encoded.
